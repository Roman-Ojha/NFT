    -> These cannot be segmented into smaller parts.
    -> Supply is limited


*) Working of NFT:
    -> EX:
        -> <painting1> + ID_1 ---> NFT
        -> painting/image get stored at IPFS or server
        
        -> <painting1> + ID_2 ---> NFT
        -> NOTE: it doesn't mean that we can't be able to make multiple copy of that image
        -> because these two image have different ID, These to are not equal NFT
